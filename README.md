# React-Todo-Lists
This is a simple and intuitive To-Do List application built using React. The application allows users to add, mark as done, and delete tasks with ease. This is my first project using React . Features Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list. Mark as Done: Tasks can be marked as completed, and they will appear with a strikethrough.
